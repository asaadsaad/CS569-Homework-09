# CS569 Homework 9
## Angular Reactive Forms
Complete the project from yesterday and build UI components to add/update a course and students. Note that all fields are required. Create an aynchromous validator to check whether a course `code` is unique, and another validator to check if the student has already been registered in the course.

**Bonus** *(Optional)*  
Integrate any [UI Kit](https://angular.io/resources?category=development) of your choice into your project.

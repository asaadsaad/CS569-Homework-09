## Angular Reactive Forms
Use the [Request Response API](https://reqres.in/) and build an Angular application with the following features:
* List all users
* Add new user
* Update user by ID
* Delete user by ID
  
**Notes**
* Type all responses according to the API.  
* Use Angular Router and Reactive Form Modules.
* The API does not add, update, delete your data. However, you will need to update your state as if it were doing so.
  
**Optional Requirements**
* Use the API to register and login and save the user state globally, then only allow using the above features only after they login.
